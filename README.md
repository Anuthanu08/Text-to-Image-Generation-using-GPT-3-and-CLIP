# Text-to-Image Generation using GPT-3 and CLIP

## Introduction

This project explores a novel method for generating images from textual descriptions by combining two state-of-the-art models: GPT-3 for text expansion and CLIP for guiding image synthesis. By leveraging GPT-3's ability to create detailed captions and CLIP's capability to align textual and visual representations, the system optimizes the latent space of a generative model (such as VQGAN) to produce high-quality images that closely match the input prompt. This report outlines the project’s motivation, methodology, implementation details, experimental results, and potential future enhancements.

## Motivation

Recent advances in natural language processing and computer vision have opened up possibilities for cross-modal applications. The Text-to-Image Generation project aims to:

1. Merge NLP and Generative Modeling: Utilize GPT-3 to enrich simple text prompts into detailed descriptions.
2. Bridge Text and Image Domains: Employ CLIP to ensure that the generated images semantically correspond to the textual descriptions.
3. Demonstrate Innovation: Offer a creative tool capable of transforming textual ideas into compelling visuals, with potential applications in digital art, content creation, and interactive systems.

## Objectives

1. Develop a pipeline that converts a simple text prompt into a detailed caption using GPT-3.
2. Use CLIP to compute text and image embeddings and guide the optimization process.
3. Leverage a generative model (e.g., VQGAN) to create images from optimized latent vectors.

## System Architecture

The project is structured around three primary components:

1. Text Expansion with GPT-3:
A short user prompt is expanded into a rich, descriptive caption using GPT-3. This step is crucial as it forms the semantic basis for image generation.

2. Embedding Computation with CLIP:
Both the detailed caption and the generated images are encoded into a shared latent space using CLIP. This alignment ensures that the text and image representations are comparable.

3. Image Generation with VQGAN:
A generative model such as VQGAN is used to produce images. A latent vector is iteratively optimized so that, when decoded, the resulting image’s CLIP embedding closely matches the text embedding.

## Data Flow

1. Input: The system accepts a simple text prompt (e.g., "A futuristic cityscape at dusk").
2. Text Expansion: GPT-3 expands this prompt into a detailed caption (e.g., "A sprawling futuristic cityscape under a twilight sky, illuminated by vibrant neon lights and soaring flying cars...").
3. Embedding Extraction: The detailed caption is processed through CLIP to obtain a text embedding. Similarly, any generated image is processed to extract its visual embedding.
4. Latent Optimization: An optimization loop adjusts the latent vector of the generative model. The loss function is defined by the negative cosine similarity between the CLIP text and image embeddings.
5. Output: The final optimized latent vector is decoded into an image that is saved for review.

## Implementation Details

1. Programming Language: Python
2. Key Libraries: PyTorch, OpenAI API (for GPT-3), CLIP, and taming-transformers (for VQGAN).

## Code Modules

1. gpt3.py: Handles interactions with GPT-3 to generate detailed captions.
2. clip_utils.py: Contains functions to load CLIP, preprocess data, and compute text/image embeddings.
3. vqgan.py: Provides methods for loading the VQGAN model and decoding latent vectors into images.
4. run_pipeline.py: Ties all modules together into a cohesive pipeline that executes the full text-to-image generation process.
5. test_pipeline.py: Automated tests that validate key functionalities of the pipeline.

## Experiments 

1. Test Prompts: Various text prompts were used, ranging from simple descriptions (e.g., "A serene beach at sunrise") to more complex ideas (e.g., "A futuristic cityscape with neon lights and flying cars").
2. Evaluation Metrics: Visual quality was assessed subjectively by comparing the generated images with the intended descriptions. CLIP similarity scores were also monitored during optimization to gauge convergence.

## Results

1. Qualitative Analysis: Generated images displayed high fidelity to the detailed descriptions provided by GPT-3. For instance, images corresponding to futuristic or surreal descriptions showed appropriate stylistic and thematic elements.
2. Optimization Performance: The iterative latent optimization process successfully increased the similarity between text and image embeddings. Loss values decreased steadily, indicating effective convergence.
